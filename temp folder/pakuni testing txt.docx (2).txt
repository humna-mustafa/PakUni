In whole app this feature “AI Match”  is not correctly working 0% correctly working.
? Current Problem (High-Level Summary)
The AI Match feature is not generating correct university recommendations.
Recommendations do not change logically with marks, ignore merit history, and do not validate eligibility based on the user’s input.
As a result, the AI Match output is unreliable and misleading.

? Detailed Issues Identified
1?? Marks-Based Recommendation Logic Is Broken
Observed Behavior:
* Increasing or decreasing marks (even by 1 mark) produces incorrect or random recommendations
* High marks do not consistently return high-merit universities
* Low or average marks sometimes return top-tier universities
* There is no visible threshold logic
Expected Behavior:
* Recommendations must be tiered by marks:
o High marks ? Top-tier universities
o Average marks ? Mid-tier universities
o Low marks ? Low-tier / fallback universities
* Small changes in marks should not drastically reshuffle results
* AI should use ranges, not exact marks only

2?? No Use of Previous Merit History (Critical Issue)
Observed Behavior:
* AI Match does not check last year or previous years’ merit lists
* Universities are recommended even if:
o The user’s marks are below historical closing merit
o The program was never offered at that merit
Expected Behavior:
* For each university + program:
o Check last 1–3 years’ merit history
o Compare user marks vs closing merit
o Only recommend if user marks fall within a realistic merit range
* Merit history must be a core data source, not optional

3?? Eligibility Is Not Validated
Observed Behavior:
* AI does not correctly verify:
o If the program exists in the selected university
o If the user’s marks are eligible for that program
o If entry test is required and user selected it
* Universities are shown even when the user is clearly ineligible
Expected Behavior:
AI must validate before recommending:
* Program availability
* Minimum eligibility criteria
* Entry test requirement (if applicable)
* Marks vs merit threshold
If any condition fails, the university should not appear in recommendations.

4?? City, University Type & Program Filters Are Weak
Observed Behavior:
* Selected filters (city, public/private, program) are not strictly enforced
* AI sometimes recommends universities:
o Outside selected city
o Outside selected university type
o With mismatched programs
Expected Behavior:
* Filters must act as hard constraints, not suggestions
* AI should only consider universities that:
o Match selected city (or explicitly marked “other cities”)
o Match university type (public / private / both)
o Offer the selected program

5?? Recommendation Ranking Is Incorrect
Observed Behavior:
* No clear ordering of universities
* Top universities appear mixed with low-tier ones
* Ranking does not reflect merit strength or competitiveness
Expected Behavior:
Recommendations must be ranked logically:
1. Best-fit universities (highest chance of admission)
2. Medium-fit universities
3. Safe / low-tier universities
Ranking factors should include:
* Merit history match
* User marks strength
* University reputation (optional weight)
* Admission probability score

6?? No Stability in Recommendations
Observed Behavior:
* Every small change in marks reshuffles the entire list
* No buffering or tolerance logic
Expected Behavior:
* AI should use:
o Merit ranges
o Probability bands
o Confidence scores
* Minor mark changes should only cause minor ranking shifts, not full changes

? What Needs to Be Done (Solution Direction)
?? Required AI Logic Improvements
1. Introduce Merit-Based Ranges
o High / Medium / Low probability buckets
2. Integrate Historical Merit Data
o At least last 2–3 years
3. Strict Eligibility Validation
o Before recommendation, not after
4. Hard Enforcement of Filters
o City, program, university type
5. Scoring & Ranking System
o Admission probability score per university
6. Stability Logic
o Prevent extreme changes for small mark variations

?? Conclusion
Currently, AI Match behaves like a random suggestion engine, not an admission-matching system.
To be fully functional:
* It must reason over data
* Validate eligibility
* Use historical merit trends
* Rank results logically
* Maintain stability across small input changes
Until these issues are fixed, AI Match recommendations cannot be trusted by students.





MERIT CALCULATOR – HAFIZ-E-QURAN MARKS ISSUE
In the Merit Calculator feature, when the user selects the “Hafiz-e-Quran” option, the system automatically adds a fixed 20 marks. This implementation is incorrect.
Each university has its own specific criteria for Hafiz-e-Quran marks, including:
* How many marks are added
* Where the marks are added (Matric, Intermediate, aggregate, or separate weightage)
* Whether the Hafiz marks are applicable at all
Currently, the app applies the same fixed value to all universities, which results in incorrect merit calculations.
Expected Behavior:
* Hafiz-e-Quran marks must be applied according to each university’s official policy
* The system must check:
o Whether the selected university accepts Hafiz marks
o How many marks are added
o At which stage of the merit calculation they are applied
* If a university does not include Hafiz-e-Quran marks, no extra marks should be added
Conclusion:
Using a fixed 20 marks for Hafiz-e-Quran across all universities is incorrect. The merit calculator must apply Hafiz-e-Quran marks dynamically based on each university’s individual merit criteria to ensure accurate and reliable results.





HOMEPAGE & ADMISSION DEADLINE ISSUES
Issue 1: Homepage “Upcoming Deadlines” Box
The “Upcoming Deadlines” box on the homepage is showing incorrect and past dates. January dates and other expired deadlines are still visible even though they have already passed. Only correct and future deadlines should appear in this box. Past dates must be removed and the box should always show up-to-date upcoming deadlines.
Issue 2: Admission Deadline Feature (Whole App)
The “Admission Deadline” feature does not show accurate or complete information. Exact admission closing dates, application opening dates, and entry test dates are missing or incorrect. Many universities whose admission deadlines have already been officially announced are not shown in the list.
The feature should display:
* Correct application open dates
* Correct application closing dates
* Correct entry test dates (if applicable)
* All universities with announced admission or test deadlines
* All currently open admissions and upcoming tests

Issue 3: “Apply Now” Button Redirection
The “Apply Now” button works for some universities, but for many it redirects to a 404 error page. Every “Apply Now” button must redirect to the correct and official admission page. Broken or incorrect links should be fixed to avoid user confusion.

Issue 4: “Following Deadlines” Count Is Incorrect
The app shows that I am following two deadlines in the “Following” section, even though I have not followed any deadline. This count is incorrect and misleading.
The “Following Deadlines” feature should:
* Show zero followed deadlines when the user has not followed any deadline
* Update the count only when a user explicitly follows or unfollows a deadline
* Reflect the correct followed deadlines in real time
* Always display updated data based on the current database state
* Ensure the database is correctly updated whenever a follow or unfollow action occurs
The displayed count and list must always match the actual data stored in the database.


Conclusion

The homepage “Upcoming Deadlines” box and the Admission Deadline feature must display accurate, up-to-date, and complete information. Past dates should not appear. All currently open admissions and upcoming tests must be listed. The “Following Deadlines” count must reflect the correct number in real time, and every “Apply Now” button must redirect to the valid and official admission page. Data should always match the database and update automatically whenever changes occur.





In whole app in “Merit Calculator” When a user selects no formula, it should mean that the system calculates merit using all available merit formulas related to the selected education system, but currently the app calculates merit for only a few formulas, which is incorrect; the system must ensure that when no formula is selected, merit is calculated for all formulas defined in the merit list for the chosen education system.

ENTRY TEST DETAILS SCREEN – BACK NAVIGATION ISSUE
In whole app In the “Entry Tests” feature, when a user selects any test and opens the test details screen, all information is displayed correctly, but there is no back arrow or navigation option at the top-left of the screen, so the user cannot easily return to the previous page; a visible back arrow or proper back navigation must be added to allow users to go back smoothly.


ENTRY TEST FEATURE – DUPLICATE & INCORRECT TEST LISTING
In the Entry Test feature, some tests (for example, NAT) are listed multiple times separately (e.g., NAT-IM, NAT-IE). Other tests may have similar variants. This causes confusion and duplicate entries in the test list.
Expected Behavior:
* Each test should appear only once in the main test list.
* Inside the test details, all variants/types (e.g., NAT-IM, NAT-IE) should be listed clearly.
* Each variant should specify the subject-based question pattern or relevant subject group.
* Tests that have the same overall pattern but differ only in subject-based questions should follow this approach.
* Users should be able to see all variants of a test from one unified entry, without duplication, also user mustat same spot identify difference, test pattern.
* Apply this rule consistently to all entry tests that have multiple types or subject-based versions.
Conclusion:
Tests with multiple subject-based or variant versions should not appear as separate entries in the main list. Each test should be listed once, with all its types/variants clearly organized inside the test details with clean ui and ux , showing differences in subjects or question patterns, while the overall test pattern remains consistent. This will reduce duplication and confusion across the app.



ENTRY TEST FEATURE – DATA ACCURACY & NAVIGATION ISSUES
In the Entry Test feature across the app, most test information is incorrect. Test dates, registration dates, and test durations for entry tests are wrong or outdated, which causes confusion for students who depend on this information.
Additionally, the “Register Now” button for many tests redirects to a 404 error page or an incorrect page instead of the official registration page. All registration buttons must link to valid, official, and verified sources.
On the test details screen, the “On Track” section (which displays the test date) must show the exact and correct test date. This date should be editable from the system database and must always remain consistent with the main test information.
The “Days” counter in the “On Track” section must automatically update every day and accurately show the number of days remaining until the test date.
The Deadline date shown inside the details screen and the date shown outside before screen where all entery tests boxes are listed(where only month and year are displayed) must be consistent and refer to the same exact test date. 

ENTRY TEST FEATURE – SEARCH BAR NOT WORKING
In the Entry Test feature, the search bar is not working properly for all listed tests. Searching by test name does not return correct or complete results, and some tests do not appear even when the correct keyword is entered.
The search functionality must work reliably in all cases and provide accurate results, similar to a top-quality search experience used by major platforms.


WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
* Verify and ensure 100% accuracy of test dates, registration dates, and test durations for all entry tests
* Use only official and reliable sources to update and maintain test information
* Fix all “Register Now” links and ensure none redirect to 404 or incorrect pages
* Sync the “On Track” test date with the main test data source
* Implement automatic daily updates for the “Days” counter
* Ensure all data updates are reflected consistently across the entire app


CAREER GUIDANCE FEATURE – DATA ACCURACY & NAVIGATION ISSUE
In the “Career Guidance” feature accros the app, the average salary shown for all careers must be accurate and verified. Currently, salary information needs to be reviewed to ensure it reflects correct and up-to-date data.

Additionally, across the app, in “Career Guidance” feature when a user clicks the “Explore” button and opens the details screen, all information is displayed correctly, but there is no back arrow or navigation option at the top-left of the screen. Because of this, users cannot easily return to the previous page.
A visible back arrow or proper back navigation must be added to all detail screens to allow users to go back smoothly and consistently.


SEARCH BAR ISSUE – STUDY GUIDES & WHOLE APP
The search bar in the “Study Guides” feature is not working properly. Searching with an exact word, partial keyword, or related term does not return correct or complete results. This makes it difficult for users to find relevant study guides.
The search functionality should work reliably in all scenarios, similar to search systems used by top tech companies. When a user searches, it should display all relevant results based on exact matches, partial keywords, and related terms.
Additionally, search bars across the entire app should follow the same standard and behavior. All app features that include a search bar must return accurate, consistent, and complete results from the database.
The search system must be fully reliable and responsive to ensure a smooth user experience throughout the app.

In whole app this feature “SCORE GAME” / “ADMISSION CHANCE CALCULATOR” – RESULT SHARING & ACCURACY ISSUES
Current Issues:
1. Sharing Results
* When a student clicks “Share My Result” after calculating chances, 
The shared results  include extra or incorrect data that is not visible on the app screen chances.
2. Accuracy of Chances
* Admission chances are currently calculated incorrectly.
* Results are not based on historical merit data.
* The calculator does not correctly account for:
o Student marks
o Program selected
o Past merit history
* Selecting “All Universities” or “All Programs” does not calculate or display all relevant chances correctly.
* Selecting a specific university or program does not correctly calculate the chance for that selection.
Expected Behavior:
* The “Share My Result” feature must allow:
o Sharing all calculated chances if “All Universities / All Programs” is selected.
o Sharing only a specific program or university if the student selects it.
o Shared content must exactly match what is displayed on the screen—no extra or missing data.
* The Admission Chance Calculator must calculate accurate chances for every program and university based on:
o Student marks
o Selected program(s)
o Selected university(ies)
o Last year and historical merit lists
* The sharing functionality must be 100% reliable and reflect exactly what the student sees in the app.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
* Fix the sharing logic to allow sharing all results or selected results according to student choice.
* Ensure shared results exactly match the displayed data, with no extra or missing information.
* Correct the admission chance calculation using all relevant inputs: marks, program, university, and historical merit data.
* Ensure “All Universities” and “All Programs” selections return complete and accurate chances.
* Implement proper testing to confirm sharing and calculation works for all possible selections.

Conclusion:
The popular careers section must provide direct, correct navigation to the corresponding career details page to improve usability and user experience.






In whole REPORT WRONG DATA FEATURE all its subfaetures – UNIVERSITY SELECTION CHANGE ISSUE
Current Issue:
* In the Report Wrong Data feature, when a user selects a specific university.
* If the user wants to change or cancel the selected university, it is not possible within the same form.
* Users currently have to discard the form and start over to select a different university.
* This applies even when the user wants to search for a new university using the search bar—changing the university via search does not update the selection.
Expected Behavior / Corrections Needed:
* Users must be able to change, deselect, or search for a new university within the same form without discarding existing input.
* When the user performs a search and selects a different university, the form should update dynamically to reflect the new selection.

* Currently, users cannot freely add, remove, or edit goals, limiting the feature’s usefulness.
Expected Behavior / Corrections Needed:
* Implement a Custom Goal Template where students can:
o Add multiple goals and sub-goals
o Set custom deadlines for each goal
o Use checkmarks to mark individual tasks/goals as completed
o Edit or remove any goal or sub-goal at any time
* Checkmarks must be interactive: when a student marks a task as completed, it visually updates and persists in the system.
* Ensure the interface is intuitive, clean, and fully functional, allowing students to manage goals easily.
Conclusion:
The MyGoal feature must allow full customization of goals, with dynamic checkmarks for tracking progress, editable deadlines, and flexible goal management for students.





POLLS FEATURE – PERFORMANCE / LOADING ISSUE
Current Issue:
* The Polls feature takes significantly longer to load compared to all other features in the app.
* This slow loading affects user experience and can discourage engagement.

Expected Behavior / Corrections Needed:
* Optimize the Polls feature so that loading time is fast and comparable to other app features.
* Ensure all poll data, including questions, options, and results, loads efficiently.
* Apply performance best practices, such as:
o Lazy loading or pagination for poll lists
o Optimized API calls
o Caching where possible
* Test performance under various scenarios (e.g., large number of polls, slow network) to ensure smooth user experience.
Conclusion:
The Polls feature must load quickly and efficiently, providing a seamless experience comparable to other features of the app.






MYACHIEVEMENTS FEATURE – UI, DATA, AND IMAGE HANDLING ISSUES
Current Issues:
1. UI Layout Problems
* Achievement cards templtes and statistics boxes are not aligned properly.
o Some boxes are placed higher, some lower; size not same, digits not correctly placed equally,spacing is inconsistent.
* Template boxes are of unequal sizes; some are large, some small.
* Overall UI lacks a clean, balanced layout, making the page look cluttered and uneven.
2. Custom Achievement Data Issues
* When creating achievements in custom templates or using pre-made templates:
o Dates entered in DD/MM/YYYY format are shown as invalid in the cards.
3. Image Handling Problems
* When adding pictures from mobile to celebration cards:
o The storage location and position of images are unclear.
o After adding an image, returning to view the achievement not display the images.
o If the image is deleted from the mobile device, it must not  disappears from the card it must still seeable exact same from certain placein celebration crads.
* Celebration cards should store images independently so they remain visible even if deleted from the device.
4. Editability Issues
* After creating an achievement or celebration card:
o Cards are not editable, including text, date, and images.
o Users cannot update or modify achievements after creation.

Expected Behavior / Corrections Needed:
1. UI Improvements
* Align all statistics boxes and achievement cards evenly.
* Make all template boxes same size for a uniform look.
* Ensure clean and consistent layout with proper spacing and alignment.
2. Data Handling
* Support DD/MM/YYYY date format correctly in all templates and cards.

* Allow adding, updating, and deleting images within the cards.
4. Editability
* Enable full editing of created achievements and celebration cards:
o Edit text, dates, images, and other details.
* Changes must persist properly and reflect immediately in the card.

Conclusion:
The MyAchievements feature must provide clean, consistent UI, proper data validation, reliable image handling, and full editability for both pre-made and custom templates, improving usability and overall experience.






COMPARE UNIVERSITIES FEATURE – LOGOS, DATA ACCURACY, AND SHARING ISSUES
Current Issues:
1. University Logos in Dropdowns / Lists
* When clicking the “+” button to select a university, the next page shows list with the universities name.
* Logos of universities are not displayed, which reduces professionalism and credibility.
* All dropdowns, search bars, and similar lists throughout the app should show respective university logos before names for better UX and credibility.
2. Incorrect Comparison Data
* All comparison details for universities are incorrect, including:
o Rankings
o Established year
o Programs offered
o Campuses (number and location)
o Fee ranges
* Some campuses and program data in the Universities page are also wrong or missing, which affects comparison accuracy.
* The comparison must only include reliable and verified data. If some data cannot be fixed, it should be skipped rather than showing wrong information.
3. Share Button Issue
* The Share button does not share the correct comparison details.
* It currently only shares partial or inaccurate information.
* All columns and all details of the selected universities must be shared exactly as displayed.

Expected Behavior / Corrections Needed:
1. University Logos
* Display logos before the university names in all dropdowns, search lists, and selection menus across the app.
* Logos must match the master dataset to maintain credibility and professional look.
2. Comparison Data Accuracy
* Verify and update all comparison data with credible sources:
o Ranking
o Established year
o Programs offered
o Campuses (number, location)
o Fee ranges
* Ensure data matches the Universities page, and consistency is maintained across the app.
* If some data cannot be verified, skip those fields rather than showing wrong information.
3. Share Functionality
* Ensure the Share button shares all comparison details correctly, exactly as displayed in the table.
* The share should include all columns, programs, fees, campuses, and other relevant data.

Conclusion:
The Compare Universities feature must provide accurate, credible, and fully shareable comparison details with professional UX. University logos should be displayed before names in all lists, and only verified data should be shown. Incorrect or missing data should be skipped rather than misrepresented.
    




In whole app THE MERIT / MERIT ARCHIVE FEATURE – DATA ACCURACY & UPDATING ISSUE
Current Issue:
* The Merit Archive / The Merit feature is completely wrong and not updated.
* All displayed data is inaccurate:
o Merit trends are wrong
o Rankings / cutoffs / stats are incorrect
o Marks and merit calculations are wrong
o Historical data is inconsistent, missing, or outdated
o Not recent dat of 2025 and 2026
* Users cannot rely on this feature for any accurate merit information.
* Data is not updating automatically when new merit lists or changes occur.
Expected Behavior / Corrections Needed:
* Verify and update all merit data using official and credible sources.
* Correct all merit trends, starts, cutoffs, and rankings.
* Ensure historical and current merit data is complete, accurate, and reflects past years correctly.
* Implement automatic updates so the feature reflects the latest merit lists and changes in real time.
* Display trends and historical data in a clear, accurate, and reliable format.
Conclusion:
The Merit Archive / The Merit feature must provide 100% accurate, verified, and up-to-date merit data, including correct trends, historical cutoffs, and rankings. Current data is completely unreliable and outdated and must be fully corrected and maintained for proper functionality and student trust.



KIDZONE – SUBJECT GUIDES PAGE & FEATURE CONSISTENCY
Current Issues:
1. UI/UX Problems
* The Subjects Guides page in KidZone has poor UI/UX:

2. Feature Consistency with Main App
* Features present in the main app (such as search functionality, filters, and content updates) are not implemented in KidZone.

o Clear, large, and easily clickable buttons
o Consistent spacing and layout for all elements
o Bright, readable colors and fonts suitable for children
o Simplified interface with only necessary elements
2. Feature Parity with Main App
* Implement all features present in the main app’s Subjects Guides page in KidZone, including:
o Search functionality (working like top companies)
o Filters and sorting options
o Content updates and corrections
* Ensure KidZone content and functionality stays consistent with the main app, while still being child-friendly.
Conclusion:
The Subjects Guides page in KidZone must be child-friendly, visually appealing, and fully functional, while incorporating all updates and features available in the main app for consistency and better UX.
