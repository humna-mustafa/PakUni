NOTIFICATION BELL – UI ISSUE (HOME PAGE)
On the Home page, clicking the notification bell (top right corner) does not open a notification screen or popup. Instead, it shows a small thin bar.
Expected behavior: Clicking the notification bell should open a proper notification screen or popup displaying user notifications clearly.
 

also on boarding pages are misisng which intercative pages  appears implemnt onboarding screens o that it only appaers once when user first app launch when user tap "Get started 
 or "Skip"   then according it but onboarding screen must professional goos like top compnaise professional .
ADMISSION FEATURES – SPRING/FALL MERIT & PROGRAM SESSION HANDLING
The app currently ignores differences between spring and fall admissions across all features:
* Some universities offer only fall, some offer both; each session has different merit requirements.
* Programs may be offered in fall, spring, or both, with different merit cutoffs.
* Features like Admission Chance Calculator, Score Game, and University Details do not account for these differences.
Fix Required:
* Apply correct spring/fall merit rules and program availability across all relevant features in app.
* Ensure calculations, results, and displayed data reflect the correct session-specific merit for each university and program.
* Shared results and all app features must respect these session-based differences.


In whole app this feature “AI Match”  for getting recommendation is not correctly working 0% correctly working.
? Current Problem 
The AI Match feature is not generating correct university recommendations.
Recommendations do not change logically with marks, ignore recent all universities recent merit history, spring and fall both for universities who offer program s in bothsessions and either one based on if it offer one ., and do not validate eligibility based on the user’s input.
As a result, the AI Match output is unreliable and misleading.

? Detailed Issues Identified
1?? Marks-Based Recommendation Logic Is Broken
Observed Behavior:
* Increasing or decreasing marks (even by 1 mark) produces incorrect or random recommendations
* High marks do not consistently return high-merit universities
* Low or average marks sometimes return top-tier universities
* There is no visible threshold logic
Expected Behavior:
* Recommendations must be tiered by marks:
o High marks ? Top-tier universities
o Average marks ? Mid-tier universities
o Low marks ? Low-tier / fallback universities
* Small changes in marks should not drastically reshuffle results
* AI should use ranges, not exact marks only

2?? No Use of Previous Merit History (Critical Issue)
Observed Behavior:
* AI Match does not check last year or previous years’ merit lists
* Universities are recommended even if:
o The user’s marks are below historical closing merit
o The program was never offered at that merit
Expected Behavior:
* For each university + program:
o Check last 1–3 years’ recnt merit history
o Compare user marks vs closing merit
o Only recommend if user marks fall within a realistic merit range
* Merit history must be a core data source, not optional

3?? Eligibility Is Not Validated
Observed Behavior:
* AI does not correctly verify:
o If the program exists in the selected university
o If the user’s marks are eligible for that program
o If entry test is required and user selected it
* Universities are shown even when the user is clearly ineligible
Expected Behavior:
AI must validate before recommending:
* Program availability
* Minimum eligibility criteria
* Entry test requirement (if applicable)
* Marks vs merit threshold
If any condition fails, the university should not appear in recommendations.

4?? City, University Type & Program Filters Are Weak
Observed Behavior:
* Selected filters (city, public/private, program) are not strictly enforced
* AI sometimes recommends universities:
o Outside selected city
o Outside selected university type
o With mismatched programs
Expected Behavior:
* Filters must act as hard constraints, not suggestions
* AI should only consider universities that:
o Match selected city (or explicitly marked “other cities”)
o Match university type (public / private / both)
o Offer the selected program

5?? Recommendation Ranking Is Incorrect
Observed Behavior:
* No clear ordering of universities
* Top universities appear mixed with low-tier ones
* Ranking does not reflect merit strength or competitiveness
Expected Behavior:
Recommendations must be ranked logically:
1. Best-fit universities (highest chance of admission)
2. Medium-fit universities
3. Safe / low-tier universities
Ranking factors should include:
* Merit history match
* User marks strength
* University reputation (optional weight)
* Admission probability score

6?? No Stability in Recommendations
Observed Behavior:
* Every small change in marks reshuffles the entire list
* No buffering or tolerance logic
Expected Behavior:
* AI should use:
o Merit ranges
o Probability bands
o Confidence scores
* Minor mark changes should only cause minor ranking shifts, not full changes

? What Needs to Be Done (Solution Direction)
?? Required AI Logic Improvements
1. Introduce Merit-Based Ranges
o High / Medium / Low probability buckets
2. Integrate Historical Merit Data
o At least last 2–3 years
3. Strict Eligibility Validation
o Before recommendation, not after
4. Hard Enforcement of Filters
o City, program, university type
5. Scoring & Ranking System
o Admission probability score per university
6. Stability Logic
o Prevent extreme changes for small mark variations

?? Conclusion
Currently, AI Match behaves like a random suggestion engine, not an admission-matching system.
To be fully functional:
* It must reason over data
* Validate eligibility
* Use historical merit trends
* Rank results logically
* Maintain stability across small input changes
Until these issues are fixed, AI Match recommendations cannot be trusted by students.




 
APP-WIDE ISSUES
1. In whole app in this feature “Merit Calculator” – Hafiz-e-Quran Marks
* The app inconsistently applies Hafiz-e-Quran marks across universities:
o Sometimes adds marks where the university does not award them
o Sometimes fails to add marks where the university does award them
o Currently uses a fixed 20 marks universally, ignoring university rules
* Expected: Apply Hafiz-e-Quran marks dynamically based on each university’s official policy throughout the app.
2. In whole app in “Entry Test” feature – Duplicate & Incorrect Test Listings
* In the Entry Test feature, NAT test details show wrong NAT variants.
* Other tests also show incorrect or incomplete test-type information.
* Expected: Either remove incorrect variants or update all test types with correct information for all tests across the app.
Conclusion: Both features need a system-wide fix to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent information.


ENTRY TEST FEATURE – DUPLICATE & INCORRECT TEST LISTING
In the Entry Test feature, the "NAT" test details show wrong NAT variants. Either remove the incorrect NAT variants or update with correct NAT type information. Other tests also have incorrect  and incomplete test-type information.

In whole app in “Deadlines” feature 
Issue 3: “Apply Now” Button Redirection
The “Apply Now” button works for some universities, but for many it redirects to a 404 error page. Every “Apply Now” button must redirect to the correct and official admission page. Broken or incorrect links should be fixed to avoid user confusion.



ENTRY TEST FEATURE – DATA ACCURACY & NAVIGATION ISSUES
Additionally, the “Register Now” button for majority tests redirects to a 404 error page or  an incorrect page instead of the official registration page. All registration buttons must link to valid, official, and verified sources.
 In “Entry Test” feature  the duration of each test written in in each test deails page in test format section differs from written in “Duration box”after “On Track ” box in details pagaes  write accurte details of test , accurate , verified , official “Durations” of all entry test.
  

ENTRY TEST FEATURE – SEARCH BAR NOT WORKING
In the Entry Test feature, the search bar is not working properly for all listed tests especiallay for “NAT test” an dits keywords. Searching by test name does not return correct or complete results, and some tests do not appear even when the correct keyword is entered.
The search functionality must work reliably in all cases and provide accurate results, similar to a top-quality search experience used by major platforms.


CAREER GUIDANCE FEATURE – DATA ACCURACY & NAVIGATION ISSUE
In the “Career Guidance” feature accros the app, the “Avg S
alary”shown for all careers must be accurate and verified. Currently, salary information needs to be reviewed to ensure it reflects correct and up-to-date data.


In whole app in “STUDY GUIDES” FEATURE – SEARCH DISPLAY ISSUE
In the Study Guides feature, performing a search shows all categories above the search results instead of displaying results correctly below the search bar. Ensure:
* Search results appear directly below the search bar.
* Categories only appear where intended, not mixed with search results.
* This applies to all study guides across the app.


SCORE GAME / ADMISSION CHANCE CALCULATOR – RESULT SHARING & ACCURACY
The feature currently has two issues across the app:
Accuracy: Admission chances are calculated incorrectly; they do not consider student marks, selected program/university, historical merit lists, or whether the student applies for spring or fall.
Fix Required:
* Update calculations using 2025–2026 merit data for all programs and universities.
* Ensure results differ correctly for spring and fall admissions.
* Ensure all selections (specific or “All Universities/Programs”) return complete, accurate chances.

In UNIVERSITIES PAGE – DATA ACCURACY & UI ISSUES
Current Issues:
2. University Logos
* Many university logos are missing or incorrectly displayed.
* An Excel file with logos  misinsg now has been provided  to you both excel file onemaster an done with currently misinsg logos link also if somemisinsg find logos from master excel file, but the app is not applying them correctly even same logos was present in previous excel universities data sheet but you miss them and dodnot paply accutaely also all logos .


UNIVERSITY LOGO CONSISTENCY – APP-WIDE
Display official university logos alongside the university name where relevant and appropriate, such as in University Details, Merit Lists, Calculators, Entry Tests, and other key sections.
Ensure logos are used only where they improve clarity and professionalism, maintaining accurate logo mapping and brand consistency across the app.

3. Filters
* Duplicate/redundant filters for provinces exist. Only one dropdown or bubble filter should be used. Also by deault make sure that filter button is off user can itself just on it because by it ux an dscreen look messy too much filter think aboutif my this opinion good then  implenet finot then left.  
* Sorting filters ( “Ranking”,)is is  not working.
4. University Details
* Subpages for universities show incomplete or incorrect data:
o  approx. many pages show “Information coming soon” or “No data available” incorrectly.
o Programs subpages show incorrect programs offered it must show all, exact same programs offred by that university also each university offred different programs also missing fees correct information for all prograsm.
o Merit subpages have no accurste data recent data, no spring fall implentatiaon if applaicable for that uni .o “Admission” subpages and “Aid” and “Merit” subpages are empty .






In TOOLS FEATURE Across the app– MERIT CALCULATOR, GRADE CONVERTER, TARGET CALCULATOR, AND WHAT-IF SIMULATOR ISSUES in tools
2. Grade Converter Tool
* The Grade Converter calculates incorrect grades to marks for all subjectsnow its marking percentage formula is wrong not accordindg actual percentage formula used in olevel and  A levels in Pakistan
.
* The tool must follow Pakistan grade and marks  conversion criteria accurately for alevel snad olevels inter and matric.
* Results must be 100% correct for all subjects grades,output marks must be 100% authentic correct and input combinations.
3. Target Calculator Tool
Not based on actual recent merit data of univeristies
* The calculation must be consistent and reliable across all scenarios.
4. What-If Simulator Tool
* The simulator calculates admission chances based on past merit, but the results are too low and inaccurate.
No merit info it has recent official, accurste merit.
* the merit estimation logic is wrong:
o It does not use recent average historical merit cutoffs accurately.
o Admission chances are underestimated or incorrect for programs and universities.
* The simulator must use last year’s average merit cutoffs and proper calculation logic to display accurate chances.
